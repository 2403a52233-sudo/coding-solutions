# Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

There is a programming language with only  **four**  operations and  **one**  variable `X`:

- ++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
- --X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.

Initially, the value of `X` is `0`.

Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return  *the  **final** value of* `X`  *after performing all the operations*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= operations.length <= 100
- operations[i] will be either "++X", "X++", "--X", or "X--".

        for(int i=0;i<operations.length;i++){
            if(operations[i].equals("++X")) X=X+1;
            else if(operations[i].equals("X++")) X=X+1;
            else if(operations[i].equals("--X")) X=X-1;
            else if(operations[i].equals("X--")) X=X-1;
        }
    return X;
    }
}
```
